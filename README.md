--AI research questions:

- 1.) What is intelligence?
- 2.) What is Objective Consciousness?
- 3.) What is Conscientiousness?
- 4.) What is Truth?
- 5.) What is Knowledge?
- 6.) What is Cognition?
- 7.) What is Comprehension?
- 8.) What is Mental abstraction?
- 9.) What is Logic?
- 10.) What are Ontology & Epistemology, and what’s the Difference Between Them?

--Should we imbue machines with such things, what might be the outcome, what is the cost of creating such models, and is it worth it?
